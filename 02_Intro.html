    <h1>HTML INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</p>
    <p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</p>
    <p>HTML consists of a series of elements</p>
    <H2>What is an HTML Element?</H2>
    <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:</p>
    <p>The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:</p>
    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
    <p>In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, 
    proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an 
    internet based hypertext system.</p>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called <b><i><u>"HTML Tags"</u></i></b>
    proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5,
     which we will learn later in this tutorial.</p>
     <h2>Syntax of Html</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</li>
        <li>The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page</li>
        <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page</li>
        <li>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)&lt;/li&gt;
        <li>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
            <li>The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading</li>
            <li>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Features of HTML</h2>
    <p>1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.</p>
    <p>2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.</p>
    <p>3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.</p>
    <p>4) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
    <p>It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it's a static language.</p>
    <p>Errors can be costly.</p>
    <p>If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.</p>
